Ophiuchus Archivist Rails Webscraper Topaz 0.0 - Feature 002

This feature branch is to create the content models.

Content is organized into Documents and Contents. Documents are top-level
entities able to exist independently. Contents are auxillary entities used by
Documents. Contents can themselves be Documents and those documents may or may
not be able to stand alone. True, independent Documents are distinguished by the
is_standalone field in the database. A value corresponding to true will indicate
that a Document is independent. Both Documents and Contents contain very little
information about the entity they represent but instead store associations to
more specialized models. The only type of Document currently is the
HtmlDocument. There are many known Content types but only two contain auxillary
information. The two specialized Content models are Image and InnerDocument.
InnerDocument contains a link to a Document instance and represents a Document
that is used as Content. Examples of such a situation include html snippets
fetched dynamically by a HtmlDocument. The snippet is treated as a Document
in order to allow it to have the Document's functionality to reference other
Content such as stylesheets, scripts and Images, even though the snippet may not
be able to be served as an independent Document.
